### What are the portable linux apps?
Portable Linux Apps are standalone applications for GNU/Linux that can (theorically) run everywhere, also on a USB stick. These applcations can be AppImage packages (see [appimage.org](https://appimage.org/)) or standalone archives (for example Firefox, Blender, Thunderbird...).

### How is this site different from other sites that list AppImage packages?
The main problem with AppImage packages is that many of them cannot be updated easily because there is no centralized repository. I've built one.

### Is there a centralized repository for AppImage packages?
Yes, I've called it "AM" (Application Manager), the following lists represent all applications currently managed by the "AM" project (see "[AM Application Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager)" on github), by architecture:
- [aarch64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/main/programs/aarch64-apps)
- [i686](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/main/programs/i686-apps)
- [x86_64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/main/programs/x86_64-apps)

### How it works?
"[AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager)" is a tool wrote in bash, it downloads the desired application and creates launchers and symlinks to made them usable normally, easilly, the way you expect from a package manager like APT, PacMan or DNF, and in some rare cases it can build on-the-fly AppImage packages in a way similar to an AUR helper. To see all the installation scripts, visit [https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/tree/main/programs](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/tree/main/programs)

### Is there a version of "AM" that does not require root privileges?
Yes, it is named "[AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan)", it allows you to choose where to install your applications into your `$HOME` directory. AppMan is also usable as a portable app (i.e. you can download and place it wherever you want) and it is able to ubdate itself wherever you want. You can already dowload it wrom [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AppMan/main/appman), but I suggest to learn more about it on the repository before you proceed. AppMan also includes a function to convert a script for "AM" to an installation script that works locally and without root privileges.

### Are the applications managed safe?
More of them are official programs, others are third-party AppImage packages built from other people (me included), you can see the links to the sources in the application's list ([here](apps.md)) or using the `-a` option of both "AM" and AppMan. If you see an app that steals your data, contains malware or does other bad stuff with your device... please report that app in a [github issue](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/issues) and I'll look into it.

### I've not understand, what should I install to manage all these applications?
- AppMan (to install applications only locally), at [https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan)
- AM (to install applications as root user), at [https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager)

### The app "Pippo" is not available in the database, how can I upload it?
You should do a fork of [https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager), if "AM" or AppMan are installed you can use the option `-t` (or `template`) to create your own script. Just follow the instructions on your terminal, in the end a directory containing all the stuff needed to install the app will be saved on your desktop, upload all the content of this directory on your "fork" and try to merge a pull request, I'll check it and (if everything is OK) I'll approve it. "AM" is open source, like this website. I suggest to start so, in this way we can have both installable apps and web pages to spread to the masses.
