# GIMP-HYBRID

 GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a cross-platform image editor.

 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight 
 Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
 
 GIMP "Hybrid" is based on GIMP "Stable" (see "gimp"), but includes 
 extra libraries and third-party plugins and suport for the old Python2.
 
 If you are a GIMP fanatic, you can rely on this build, alternatively
 rely on the official Flatpak which already has everything you are 
 looking for.

 "Hybrid" Is still a work in progress. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
