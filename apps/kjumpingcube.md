# KJUMPINGCUBE

 Conquer all squares on a board either by occupying an empty
 square or conquering your opponent's. A maxed out square will
 distribute its points around it, causing empty squares to be
 occupied. Watch out for chain reactions! 
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
