# VLC+

 VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework
 that plays most multimedia files as  well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and 
 various streaming  protocols. 
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage of the lates version built from one of the 
 best PPAs for Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver) including the following 
 plugins:

 * vlc-plugin-access-extra
 * vlc-plugin-fluidsynth
 * vlc-plugin-jack
 * vlc-plugin-notify
 * vlc-plugin-samba
 * vlc-plugin-skins2
 * vlc-plugin-svg
 * vlc-plugin-video-splitter
 * vlc-plugin-visualization
 
 NOTE, this AppImage requires the following dependences installed on the host
 to work with the H.264 codec:
 - "ffmpeg"
 - "libqt5svg5" (on Debian and derivatives) or "qt5-svg" (on Arch Linux and 
   derivatives, Solus and Void) or "qt5-qtsvg" (on Fedora, CentOS and other 
   distributions)
   
 If you have any compatibility issues, you can refer to "vlc" instead, which 
 is based on JuNest (Arch Linux) and really runs on any GNU/Linux distro old 
 or newer.
