# ABIWORD

 Abiword is a light and free word processing software that will not make you 
 regret the more expensive suite of programs from famous brands.
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built from Debian Stable, so this should work
 on systems with a GLIBC version equal or higer than the one used in Debian 
 Stable.
