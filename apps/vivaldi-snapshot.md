# VIVALDI-SNAPSHOT

 Vivaldi is an advanced chromium-based web browser made with the power user in mind. Desktop Snapshots are work-in-progress builds that are available  for anyone to download and test.
 
 NOTE: This database provides an installation script for aarch64 (which only  extracts the official deb package for ARM) and one for x86_64 (which points  to the unofficial AppImage package built from the official deb package for  amd64/64bit).
