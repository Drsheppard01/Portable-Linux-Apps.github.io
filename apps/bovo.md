# BOVO

 Opponents alternate in placing their pieces on the
 board trying to connect five pieces in an unbroken
 row while trying to block the opponent's pieces. 
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
