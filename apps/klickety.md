# KLICKETY

 Klickety is a simple, yet challenging color matching game
 modeled after once famous game of SameGame. The idea behind
 Klickety is to completely clear the game board filled with
 the multicolored marbles. Klickety also offers a SameGame
 mode called KSame. 
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
