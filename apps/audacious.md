# AUDACIOUS

 Audacious is an open source audio player. Originally a descendant of XMMS,
 Audacious plays your music how you want it, without stealing away your 
 computerâ€™s resources from other tasks.

 This is the unofficial AppImage built from Debian Stable, so this should 
 work on systems with a GLIBC version equal or higer than the one used in 
 Debian Stable.
