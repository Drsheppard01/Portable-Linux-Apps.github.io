# MPV

 MPV is a free (as in freedom) media player for the command line.
 It supports a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video
 codecs, and subtitle types.
 
 This AppImage requires "ffmpeg" to be installed on your system.
 
 WARNING: this is the UNOFFICIAL AppImage built from PPA and may not
          work due to the continuous changes and new libraries 
          required and only available on bleeding edge distributions.
          Rely on the version available for your distribution instead!
