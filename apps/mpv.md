# MPV
 
 MPV is a free (as in freedom) media player for the command line. It supports a 
 wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs and subtitle types.
 
 This is the unofficial Appimage of MPV Media Player built on top of JuNest, a 
 lightweight Arch Linux-based, or Debian. For functionality reasons, "AM"/AppMan
 will tend to use the latest available version or the oldest and well-tested 
 version, it all depends on the bugs that can manifest themselves in any new 
 build deriving from Arch Linux.
