# CITRA

 Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger  written in C++.
 It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS.
 
 Citra emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for  running/debugging homebrew applications, and it is also able to run  many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state,  but Citra Team is working every day to advance the project forward.
  
 EDIT: "Playable here means compatibility of at least "Okay" on our  game compatibility list."
