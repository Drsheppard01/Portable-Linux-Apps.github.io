# CITRA

   Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++.
   It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS.

   Citra emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications,
   and it is also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state, 
   but Citra Team is working every day to advance the project forward. 
   (Playable here means compatibility of at least "Okay" on our game compatibility list.)
