# GRIDCOIN-RESEARCH

 Gridcoin is a POS-based cryptocurrency that rewards users for participating 
 on the BOINC network. Gridcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with 
 no central authority - managing transactions, issuing money and contributing 
 to scientific research are carried out collectively by the network.
