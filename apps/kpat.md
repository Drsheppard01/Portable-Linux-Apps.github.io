# KPAT

 A relaxing solitaire game. Arrange the cards in a certain order, either by 
 the same color or alternating colors, in the shortest time possible.
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a
 lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of 
 disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic 
 GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 NOTE: due to "proot", a dialog message should appear at start, about a 
 missing kpat directory to download. Press "OK" or Enter to ignore it.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
