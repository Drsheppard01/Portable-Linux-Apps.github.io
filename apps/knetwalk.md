# KNETWALK

 Construct a network by connecting all terminals to the server
 with wires by rotating these elements around. Use as few
 rotations as possible. 
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
