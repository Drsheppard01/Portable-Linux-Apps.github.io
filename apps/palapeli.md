# PALAPELI

 Palapeli is a jigsaw puzzle game. Unlike other games in 
 that genre, you are not limited to aligning pieces on 
 imaginary grids.
 The pieces are freely moveable. 
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
