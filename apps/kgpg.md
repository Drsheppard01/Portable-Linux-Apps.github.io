# KGPG

 Kgpg manages cryptographic keys for the GNU Privacy Guard, and
 can encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify files. It features a 
 simple editor for applying cryptography to short pieces of text,
 and can also quickly apply cryptography to the contents of the
 clipboard. 

 This tool is part of the KDE Utils Suite.
