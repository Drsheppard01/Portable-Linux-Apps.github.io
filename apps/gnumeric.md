# GNUMERIC

 Gnumeric is an open-source spreadsheet program. Gnumeric and its source 
 code are available free of charge, licensed under the terms of the GNU 
 General Public License version 2 or version 3.
 
 Gnumeric starts up quickly and handles large spreadsheets while remaining
 responsive. A spreadsheet should calculate the right answer. Gnumeric's 
 built-in functions and tools are accurate as several, researchers, have 
 found.
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built from Debian Stable, so this should work
 on systems with a GLIBC version equal or higer than the one used in Debian 
 Stable.
